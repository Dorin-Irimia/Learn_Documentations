## 1. Pickit3 Programmer
> aplication_v3.10

### First step:
- Extract the folder and read the readme.txt file inside it.
- Install the program using the specified method.
- To connect the Pickit3 device to your microcontroller, look for the wiring diagram for it.
  - This project used the PIC16F887 microcontroller and so, I have attached an image of how it was connected.

### Second step:
- Make sure you have connected the pickit3 device to your computer via USB.
- Open the previously installed pickit3 program and access the Tools section from the top bar.
- Click on the "Check Communication" button.
- > After the connection is established, you can try to clear the microcontroller's memory using the "Erase" button. It is located in the main program window.

### Third step:
- From the top bar, select "File" and go to the "Import Hex" section.
- Select the file with the ending "hex" that you want to load into the microcontroller.

### Fourth step:
- From the main page of the program, set the voltage in the box below the "Microchip" logo, and check the boxes labeled "On" and "/MCLR".
- Press the "Write" button and wait for the execution to finish.
- Deselect the "On" and "/MCLR" boxes, which were previously enabled.
  - I have attached a picture of the programming completion. (The "On" case is active to power my circuit).
